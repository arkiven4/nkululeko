# Data

This is the default top directory for Nkululeko data import.

Each database should be in its own subfolder (you can also use `ln -sf`` to soft link original database path to these subfolders) and contain a README how to import the data to Nkululeko CSV or audformat.

## Accessibility

The column `access` in the table below indicates the database's accessability. The following values are used:
- `public`: the database is publicly available in the internet and can be downloaded directly without any restrictions.
- `restricted`: the database is publicly available on the internet but requires registration or other restrictions to download.
- `private`: the database is not publicly available on the internet and requires the private information of the owner of the dataset.
